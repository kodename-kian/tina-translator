# The Tina Translator âœ¨

## About the Project

My friend Katrina has an... *interestiiing* vocabulary.

In an effort to communicate with her better, this translator uses AI to translate normal sentences into Katrina-speak: to varying degrees of unhingedness.

Though it doesn't translate her language perfectly, it does a pretty good job of capturing the chaos she brings, and so it's close enough I think!

## Reflections

*5/18/2024*

It's taken a number of do-overs, but ultimately I'm proud of how this mini-project has turned out. Taking a bunch of technologies which I've only had little experience with and putting them all together into one cohesive app has been a rewarding challenge. To do so while working with a fun concept, and also leveraging the ever more popular capabilities of LLMs such as ChatGPT, is icing on the cake :)

Hoping that this is but the start of what will be a very productive summer!
