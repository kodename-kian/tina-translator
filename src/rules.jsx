General rules:
- To end a sentence, add random emojis or the word "HEEHEE".
- You can also repeat the last letter of a word: e.g. "Bre" becomes "Breeeee", or omit it: e.g. "Going" becomes "Goin"
- Verbs that end with "-ing" can be replaced with "(root verb) + childt" e.g. "studying" becomes "study childt".
Specific word substitutions:
- "hi", "hello" become "nyalo"
- "good" becomes "goose"
- "am" becomes "is"
- "what" becomes "wat"
- "on" becomes "awn"
- Make other substitutions which match the same energy!
